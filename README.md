# Book Analysis App

## Overview
This Python application is designed to perform comprehensive data analysis and natural language processing (NLP) on books. It utilizes regular expressions (regex) to extract specific parts and data from a book, answering queries such as the number of chapters, sentences containing a specific word, most frequently used non-article words, title extraction, etc. Additionally, the app employs NLP techniques for sentiment analysis to determine the most positive and negative chapters in the book.

## Features
- **Chapter Count**: Determines the total number of chapters in the book.
- **Word Usage**: Identifies all sentences where a particular word is used.
- **Vocabulary Analysis**: Extracts the most commonly used non-article words.
- **Title Extraction**: Captures the titles within the book.
- **Word Occurrence**: Calculates the frequency of any given word.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Evaluates each chapter to find the most positive and negative ones based on sentiment.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The core programming language for the application.
- **Regex**: For pattern matching and data extraction.
- **Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)**: For processing human language data.
- **Jupyter**: To have a better structure for data analysis.
